//  Write any number of Java interface types in appropriate packages, to represent your APIs. Note, these must be Java code files that compile and contain extensive comments to explain the purpose of each interface and each declared method (this basic code can be be generated directly from a UML diagram or used to create a diagram). Include any Exceptions you plan to throw because of errors that might occur within these methods. Note, this does not require that all of these types will remain as interfaces in the final implementation, just that the goal is for you to focus on each type's behavior and purpose rather than its state.
