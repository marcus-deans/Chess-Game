//  Pick at least five use cases and provide example "implementations" using only methods declared in your code interfaces. Note, these must be Java code files that compile and contain extensive comments explaining how you expect your different APIs to collaborate. You can implement each Use Case either in a single class to show how the steps are connected "procedurally" or in separate classes (that implement the necessary interfaces) to show how the steps are "distributed" across objects. In either case, make it clear which how the provided implementation relates to the Use Case. To make code that compiles, you will need to create simple "mocked up" example objects that implement your interfaces so you have something concrete to create, using new, and call methods on.
